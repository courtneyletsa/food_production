# food_production

📌 Project Overview

This project explores the environmental impact of different food products using data analysis and visualization techniques. The goal is to uncover insights into how food production contributes to carbon emissions, land use, water consumption, and other environmental factors.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages Python’s data science libraries.
